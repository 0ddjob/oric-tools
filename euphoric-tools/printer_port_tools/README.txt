These are obsoleted tools...
Before providing disk and tape tools that allow a PC to directly read or write
Oric disks and Oric tapes, I was explaining how to build a special cable to
link the Oric and the PC, and providing these tools to transfer tapes and
disks from an Oric to the PC.
This required the ability to solder its own cable, so few people used them...
The old sources are still available here...
