RANDOS 1.1 is an excellent Disk Operating System for the Oric, with features such
as Directories, formatted and unformatted files, etc.
Oric intended to provide the Stratos with an extended RANDOS 2 version,
unfortunately Oric collapsed before delivering it.

RANDOS uses a File System rather similar to Microsoft's DOS, so it would be a
nice thing to modify it in order to have disks that can be directly read on
PCs... one day, maybe...

Here is a tool that allows to put or extract files in a RANDOS image disk...

NB: I have also modified a RANDOS version for use with an IDE hard disk on the
Oric, an emulation of it works under Euphoric, but the real IDE interface still has
electrical problems...
