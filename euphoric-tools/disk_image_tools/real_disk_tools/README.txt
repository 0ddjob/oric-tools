Here you will find programs for reading or writing real Oric floppy disks on a
PC. Well these are old tools, written for DOS. They won't work on any modern
Windows version. Even on Windows 98, you had to restart to DOS mode to be able
to run these programs...

The problem is that they use Bios calls in real mode... I will have to find
another way with modern operating systems, but don't count on it tomorrow...
