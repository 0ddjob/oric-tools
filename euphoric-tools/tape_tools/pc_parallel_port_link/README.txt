Here are obsolete tools that allowed to send programs to an Oric with a simple
link from the parallel port of the PC to the tape port of the Oric...

Programs could be sent at normal speed using sendtape, or you could first send
a loader with sendtape and then send files much faster with fasttape...

It is now much more logical to connect the tape port of the Oric to the
soundcard's output of the PC...
