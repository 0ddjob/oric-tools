These are obsolete tools that were useful several years ago when Euphoric used
a compact 4800 Hz format for tape images. This simple format was a 1-bit sampling of the real tape, at 4800 Hz.

It has been obsolated when I switched to .wav format, more practical to use
with different audio tools. So Euphoric now takes .wav files sampled on 8 bits
at 4800 Hz. The result is that these wav files are 8 times bigger than the old
.4k8 files, but who cares now with gigabytes of storage ?

tapto4k8 converts a .tap image to a .4k8 one.
4k8totap converts a .4k8 image to a .tap image, if possible (if the recording
has a standard Oric format, i.e. if the programs are not encoded with a copy
protection scheme).

4k8towav converts a .4k8 tape image to a .wav file at 4800 Hz.
4k8towav44 converts a .4k8 tape image to a .wav file at 44100 Hz.
