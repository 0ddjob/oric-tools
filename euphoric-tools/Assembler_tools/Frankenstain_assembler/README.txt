Here you will find my favorite 6502 assembler on the PC.
It is not mine, it comes from Mark Zenier's Frankenstein series of assembler.

As it generates a HEX file, I've written a small hex2oric tool that converts
it to an Oric tape file.

Also, the assembler is able to produce a nice listing output of the assembly,
with a symbol table that you can use with Euphoric's debugger, so that
addresses in the debugger can be replaced by symbols.
